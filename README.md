# LOCKv2
Python password generator program

my first project in python.
LOCKv2 is actually LOCKv1 but with some changes and improvements.
be prepered for LOCKv3 the last version of LOCK project :)

--What is LOCKv2 ?
Its a password generator written in python3
It can generate any random password for user based on inputes
just enter how much characters and numbers, and you will see your randomized password.


--What will be in LOCKv3 ?
My last update on this project will be creating a personal password database and using a gpg encryption for its security.
that way you only need to save your public key and enter to LOCKv3.
